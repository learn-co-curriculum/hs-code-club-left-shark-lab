# Best Performance Ever

Make sure your volume is on when you start this lab!!

Your job is to choreograph some magic to happen during the Best Performance ever using jQuery methods and selectors. We have three heavy-hitters joining us: Justin Bieber, Kanye and Left Shark!!

## Let's Get Started

### Step 1:

Click `Open` at the top of this page to bring this lesson down so you can edit files in Nitrous.

### Step 2:

Open `index.html` in the browser by running in terminal `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. 

Once you have the server running, select `preview` and then `port 3000`.

### Step 3:

You're going to code your solution in `js/script.js`. Go ahead and open that file in the Nitrous text editor, as well as `index.html`. You shouldn't need to make any changes to `index.html` in order to code your solution. Don't worry about the code in `css/style.css`. All the styling has be written for you, and will work perfectly if you don't change the HTML.


### Step 4:

Let's first take care of Kanye. Because seriously, we don't really need him there. I mean, Bieber and Left Shark make an amazing duo. Let's use the `fadeOut` method to get rid of Kanye. You'll be coding your solution in `js/script.js` We've set up a `hover` event, which means the `fadeOut` will be trigged when you hover your mouse over Kanye.

Save your changes before you refresh the page in the browser. Hover your mouse over Kanye to watch him disappear!

### Step 5:

Bieber has some serious dance moves. He can shrink himself down real small and then come out BIG repeatedly. Use the `slideToggle` method to make Bieber grown and shrink when you hover the mouse over him. This time, we haven't set up the `hover` event for you.

Save your changes before you refresh the page in the browser. Hover your mouse over Bieber to watch his moves!

### Step 6:

Now it's time for Left Shark to shine. We're going to make Left Shark disappear and then reappear using the `fadeOut` and `fadeIn` methods. You'll want to use `fadeOut` first so that he disappears and then use `fadeIn` to make him reappear!

Save your changes before you refresh the page in the browser. Hover your mouse over Left Shark to watch his tricks!



## Done and Done

Lastly, you need to enter in terminal in Nitrous `learn submit`. This command will push your work to GitHub and mark this lesson as complete in Learn!
